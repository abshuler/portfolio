        <p class="body">Through my network I connected to Global CI, an IT consultancy, who felt their current website portrayed their company as a “staffing agency” and were looking for a revamp. They also had recently launched a new logo for their company and wanted to refresh their branding to match.</p>

        <p class="body">Global CI struggled to communicate their offerings to their customers through content, website layout, and downloadable assets. This meant their website was drawing minimum traffic and not being utilitized as a business generator. Without a dedicated UX team (or web manager, product owner, etc), they needed outside help to accomplish this.

Participants could also create their own categories.</p>
